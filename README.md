# 4 hours of understanding requirements and coding.
The requirements were a little bit strange for me. 
Because I've never developed any kind of financial application. 

# 1 hour of testing and fixing cross browser issues.
`display:flex` dose not work well with Firefox. 
It made the 'time icon' was not well aligned.
I spent a ton of time to fix this issue.

# 3  hours of learning, installing and applying Karma
I've never used Karma before. But I was very excited to apply it in this project.
 Every applications need to be tested and automation testing is a good solution.
